## State Management Architecture

### Global State Requirements

#### Auth State
```dart
class AuthState {
  User? user;
  bool isAuthenticated;
  String? sessionToken;
  Map<String, dynamic> preferences;
}
```

#### Profile State
```dart
class ProfileState {
  Profile? profile;
  StudentId? studentId;
  List<Department> departments;
  String? avatarUrl;
}
```

#### Campus State
```dart
class CampusState {
  Campus? selectedCampus;
  WeatherData? weather;
  List<Event> campusEvents;
}
```

#### UI State
```dart
class UIState {
  bool isDarkMode;
  String locale; // 'no' or 'en'
  Map<String, bool> loadingStates;
  List<Notice> activeNotices;
}
```

## API Integration Patterns

### REST API Calls
```dart
// Example pattern for API calls
Future<List<Event>> fetchEvents(String? campusId) async {
  final query = campusId != null 
    ? [Query.equal('campus_id', campusId)]
    : [];
    
  return databases.listDocuments(
    databaseId: 'app',
    collectionId: 'events',
    queries: query
  );
}
```

### Real-time Subscriptions
```dart
// WebSocket subscription pattern
final subscription = realtime.subscribe([
  'databases.app.collections.chats.documents',
  'databases.app.collections.chat_messages.documents'
]);

subscription.stream.listen((response) {
  // Handle real-time updates
});
```

### File Upload Pattern
```dart
Future<String> uploadFile(File file, String bucketId) async {
  final result = await storage.createFile(
    bucketId: bucketId,
    fileId: ID.unique(),
    file: InputFile.fromPath(path: file.path)
  );
  return result.$id;
}
```
